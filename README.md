# ProMicro
There are all kinds of extension shields for the Arduino Uno and hundreds of breakout boards for various sensors. All [ProMicro modules](https://github.com/nerdyscout?tab=repositories&q=ProMicro) are a redesign of such boards, which still could be used for tinkering on a breadboard, but they are also stackable onto the [ProMicro](https://github.com/sparkfun/Pro_Micro).

# ProMicro_GPS
GPS receiver module with Arduino ProMicro compatible footprint.
